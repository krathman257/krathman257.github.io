<h1>Kyle Rathman's Digital Whiteboard</h1>
<h2>Combination Project Blog and Idea Storage Unit</h2>
<p>Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! I've dug out this digital trench to store my project ideas, notes and progress. Some of these projects are more conceptual "for the future"-type notes, and others I've put a lot of time into making realities. Either way, anything on this blog is an idea I've felt is worth turning into HTML.</p>
<h2>Latest Posts</h2>
<ul>
	{% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}
	{% assign project = site.projects | where:'short_name', post.project | first %}
	{% if project %}
	<li>
		<p><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> {% include dateFormat.html date=post.date %} - {{ project.name }}</p>
		{{ post.excerpt }}
	</li>
	{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
