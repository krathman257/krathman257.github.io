project: embedded

I've recently started a journey into programming for embedded systems, and I hope it's a long and informative one. Saying it won't be easy the understatement of the epoch.

I've borrowed a book from the library, an O'Reilly book titled *Programming Embedded Systems* by Michael Barr. It's from 2006, so being almost 20 years old doesn't help it much, but I'm sure the concepts included are still valuable, and will be a good jumping-off point for future research. Certainly it's held up with technical documents I've found online so far.

The board the book recommends using is an Arcom VIPER-Lite board, which apparently came with an entire development kit. That'd be terrific if I was reading this in 2006, but that thing is $3,000 on eBay in the futuristic space year of 2024, so I guess I'll just have to make to with my futuristic space year technology. The book makes a point of saying that that board is only used as a reference point, anyway.

In the vein that the best board is the board one already has, I'll be experimenting on two boards: an Elegoo Uno R3 (a Chinese-made Arduino) and a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (the device what I'm typing this post on). I'll be examining the technical differences more as I go along, but so far, it looks like the Arduino is a lot less "roomy" than the ViperLite, and the Pi is much "roomier" (refering to processor clock speed, available memory, etc).

It's actually been a lot of fun looking over the schematic and map of the Arduino. I can tell that I've got a lot (A LOT a lot) of electrical engineering to learn, but more than a bit of it is coming back to me from my Computer Architecture class at college.

If any of the manuals or links posted below prove helpful further down the line, I'll be sure to add them to the main project page.
