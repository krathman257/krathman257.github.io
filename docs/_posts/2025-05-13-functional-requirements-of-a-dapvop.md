project: dvdplayer
---
I've decided to think more seriously about turning my laptop into a DVD player, and I figured it was about time to write down some notes about what exactly I want the end product to look like. I have an idea or two on how I want the technical side to look (which OS to use, for example), but for now, I want to focus on formalizing what I want the end product to actually DO.

I've also, as I was naming this post, decided to call it a Dapvop. DVD laptop. I'm the best at naming.

## Applications

The most important feature, naturally, is the ability to play DVDs. I'm almost positive that I wouldn't be able to get it to play Blu-ray, but that can be something to look into, as well. It should behave more or less like a typical DVD player: just pop in, press play, and enjoy the ride. The DVD menu should be functional if possible.

I also frequently use my "smart" TV for ambient Youtube videos, to have background noise/music while I read. Having Youtube in general would be a very useful feature. It should have easily selectable bookmarks to playlists or channels that I can have autoplaying with as little need for additional input as possible. Youtube should be searchable, and bookmarks should be easy to add or remove. Youtube should be, as much as possible, free of ads.

Lots of my digital media is in the form of digital media I've ripped for personal use. It's a lot easier to have a folder of MP3s than it is to flip through the 25-disc Twilight Zone collection. The Dapvop should be able to easily load, select and play MP3s as well as DVDs and Youtube videos.

## Controls

These 3 main functions should be accessed from a main menu that's simple to navigate to and easy to use. It should be operated by a remote control, without needing to open the Dapvop and use the keyboard or trackpad (though having that be an option wouldn't be a bad idea, especially when searching through Youtube.

## Performance

It should be faster to load a (bookmarked) video on the Dapvop than it is to load the same video from the smart TV's interface. Times naturally vary, but including loading bloatware apps, the Youtube app loading, and skipping ads, it takes about 45 seconds to load a recommended video from the TV's sleep state, and about 90 seconds from a fresh restart. Obviously, a fresh restart is going to have to wait for the TV to finish loading, with or without a DVD playing laptop. That said, if I can set the Dapvop to be the default input, I can hopefully at least cut down the amount of corporate bloat that's shoved in my face every time I turn the ding dang thing on.

## Movability

The software for this project should be easy to port to other devices. I don't want to have to wipe the laptop's hard drive, and it should be able to be used on other laptops with similar input and output ports.
