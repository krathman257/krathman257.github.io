# About page

My name is Kyle Rathman, and you've managed to stumble onto the project blog and stylized journal-y thing I've decided to put online. I figured this would be a good way to keep project notes and progress in a place that's more (slightly) more visible than the handwritten journal and pile of chicken-scratch index cards that dot my desk.

For a bit of background, I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Psychology from Montana State University. I've worked on a wide variety of programming projects, ranging from humanoid robot mobility and interaction, SQL database design and interfacing, Android Studio development, Unity3D projects, and fiddling with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos. Generally speaking, my engineering interests include robotics, space exploration, and virtual reality.

This blog is meant to be a bit more informal, and as such, there's no sort of posting schedule; I'll make a post whenever I feel like I've made the kind of progress worth writing about, or need a place to rubber-duck an issue out. What's more, this site was made using Jekyll, with no premade templates (besides the preset `post` formatting that Jekyll uses to keep things simple). That said, this site may lack quality of life features, but they can always be added as needed. It'll force me to learn to add what I need; it's more fun this way :)
