The library I work at uses the Library of Congress classification system to organize the nonfiction collections. Starting out, the codes all looked like gibberish to me. Why do some codes start with one letter, others with three? Why are some parts of the code sorted alphabetically, and others numerically? I wanted to learn the system, and I figured the best way to do that (never being one to do things the easy way) would be to build an Android app categorizing the system.
