This is mostly a placeholder for an idea that I don't want to lose.

In the past, I've found that I learn better when I've got a practical application to work towards, so I've been trying to think of a solid idea on what exactly to do with the embedded systems knowledge I'm dipping my toes into. Since the pipe dream is to work on planetary probes, I thought it might be a good idea to try designing one. Naturally, getting to space is, put briefly, nontrivial, so I might as well start with the planet I'm already on.

The broad goal of this project would be to create a mobile robot with some degree of autonomy and scientific merit. It doesn't have to be particularly *novel* science, by any means, but I would want some degree of relevant data collection.

I've noticed there's a local chapter of the National Speleological Society... Hmmm...
