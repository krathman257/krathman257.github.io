I'm experimenting with writing software for embedded systems. Since I'm just starting out, all of my work here will very much be in a "prototyping" stage. Given my interest in robotics and space probes, this feels like a natural step to take to eventually work my way into those fields.

I'll be working with two boards:
- An Elegoo (see: Arduino) Uno R3
- A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
