Combining a aged laptop with a mostly-useless Smart TV might be a bit overdoing it, but I might as well use it as an opportunity to learn some more Linux.

Smart TVs are too smart for their own good. Poor things, they don't know how bloated their software is. Everytime I want to watch a simple Youtube video, I need to go through autoplaying advertisments and loading screens. It's a small problem to have, to be sure, but what if I could use this problem to learn something?

I've got a laptop, all but worthless. I mean, it still works, but watching it try to boot up Windows 10 is like watching Thomas Parnell's Pitch Drop Experiment. It does, however, have a CD drive, and I'm sure it would to better with a lighter-weight operating system.

That sucker's getting turned into a DVD player.
